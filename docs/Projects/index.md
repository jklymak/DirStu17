## Project 1:

   - *Reading* Chapter 1 Baines
   - *Technical*:  
      - Setup computer to run MITgcm in parallel [See here](/install)
      - Download [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org) and install
      - Setup and run a simple test case: mean stratified flow over a Gaussian bump (See Klymak et al 2010, *JFM*, but w/ less resolution)
      - Plot the result of the model showing snapshots as the model spins up.  
   - *Hand in*:
      - A [jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook with your plots in it.  
      - A github repository link to your *modified* code.  For an mitgcm run this usually means the `code`, and `input` directories.
