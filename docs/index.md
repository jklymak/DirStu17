### Topographic Effects in Stratified Flows and Turbulence

Students:  Lina Rotermund and Ken Hughes

  - Instructor: [Jody Klymak](http://web.uvic.ca/~jklymak)
  - Office: [Bob Wright Centre](http://www.uvic.ca/buildings/sci.html) A313
  - Tel: (250)-472-5969; Email: [jklymak@uvic.ca](mailto:jklymak@uvic.ca)

## Course Objectives ##

  - Learn the theoretical treatments of stratified flow over topography.
  - Gain experience in numerical simulation of small-scale ocean flows.
  - Gain experience in analyzing simulated data and comparing to theoretical predictions


## Texts

Largely *Topographic Effects in Stratified Flows* by Peter G. Baines (Cambridge Press, 1995).

We may also choose some apropos topics from *The Turbulent Ocean* by S. A. Thorpe (Cambridge Press, 2005)

See also [Kundu and Cohen](http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpFME00004/viewerType:toc/root_slug:fluid-mechanics-4th), 4th edition.

## Course grading

There will be six or seven numerical/analytical projects, based on readings from the text(s), each of equal weight towards the course grade.  There is no final exam, and students should expect the projects to carry over into the exam period.
